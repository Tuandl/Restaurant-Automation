<h1>Project Description - Restaurant Automation</h1>

The goal for this project is to introduce automation in privately-owned restaurants, that is, small- to medium-sized establishments. Typical problems restaurant personnel are facing include: </br>
• Coordination of their work activities </br>
• Anticipating and handling periods of low/high patron traffic </br>
• Recognizing trends early enough to take advantage of bestsellers or abandon the flops</br> 
• Lowering operating costs, and increasing efficiency/productivity and profits </br>

Many restaurants are still operated using pen and paper methods, with little or no automation (see Figure 1). Patrons enter the facility to be greeted by a host, who often times has a “dry erase” diagram of the tables, maintained on a blackboard. The host can see the status of the tables based on whether or not they or someone else physically updates the diagram. Once seated a waiter tends to the costumers by jotting down the orders onto a piece of carbon paper and delivers it to the kitchen for proper food preparation. The waiter then has to periodically check back to find out when the meal is ready. When the food is done, the piece of carbon paper is saved for proper record keeping by the management. This “old fashion” system works but yields a large amount of tab receipts, wastes a lot of time and is simply out-of-date. In old fashion systems, waiters have to carry pads around to take orders, always have a working pen and be sure to keep each bill organized and “synchronized” with the proper table. 

Another issue is record maintenance. In the old system, when everything is done by paper, the management is responsible to keep all information saved and organized, which is no easy task. 

Everyday tabs are collected, data needs to be organized and employees need to get paid. This requires a great deal of time and attention from the managers. 

This project computerizes restaurant operation so that all information pertaining to patron’s orders and staff activity will be conveniently shared and stored over the restaurant’s intranet. 

Hosts will be able to view table status with a click of a button. The wait staff will be able to enter the patron’s orders quickly and efficiently and then have it electronically delivered to the kitchen. 

The kitchen staff will be able to view the incoming orders and notify the proper wait staff when the food is ready. Bus boys will be able to view real-time floor status allowing them to know which tables are clean, dirty, or occupied. Most importantly, all of the restaurant information is organized and saved in the system database for the management viewing and archival. The analysis will consist of by-the-day and by-the-hour breakdowns of: </br>
• Revenue and revenue percentage per menu item </br>
• Menu item popularity </br>
• Personnel efficiency </br>
• Average turnaround time (how long patrons spend in the restaurant) </br>
• Average preparation time (time from when the order is placed to when it is ready) </br>

There is no more abundance of papers and long hours of punching numbers. All data is automatically collected and processed allowing management to focus on analyzing the data rather than calculating it.
